                     feel comfortable (including psychologically) and<br>well.
                      We are supported by 87 volunteers
                      and 28 employees of<br>various skill levels.
                      About 12% of the animals are taken by the<br>shelter staff.
                       Taking care of the animals,
                     they become attached<br>to the pets and would hardly ever
                      leave them alone.
